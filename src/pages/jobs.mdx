# Jobs

Nitric provides functionality for provisioning long running batch workloads and High Performance Computing (HPC).

## Definitions

### Batch

A Batch is like a Nitric service, but is designed to be run as a single unit of work with a start and a finish.

### Job Definitions

Job definitions are defined as a part of batches and represent a single unit of work that work that can be run within a Nitric `Batch`

### Job

A Job is an instance of a Job Definition that is running within a `Batch`, these can be created from Nitric services or other Nitric batches.

## Limitations of Jobs

Jobs are designed to be long running HPC workloads and can take some time to spin up. They are not designed with reactivity in mind and are not suitable for responding to events from cloud resources.

Jobs are unable to run the following:

- Topic Subscriptions
- Bucket Notifications
- API & HTTP resources
- Websocket message handlers

Jobs can be used to read and write to/from all nitric resources.

## Defining a Job

<CodeGroup>

```typescript
import { jobDefinition, JobContext } from '@nitric/sdk'

const myJob = jobDefinition('analyse').define((ctx: JobContext) => {
  // Do some work
})
```

```python
from nitric.resources import job_definition
from nitric.application import Nitric
from nitric.context import JobContext

# Define will allow the developer to fine-tune the job option, such as adding resource dependencies (e.g. CPU, Memory, GPUs) etc.
@job_definition("analyse").define()
async def generate_image(ctx: None):
    # Do some work


Nitric.run()
```

</CodeGroup>

## Submitting Jobs for Execution

Jobs may be submitted from Nitric `services`.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
import * as nitric from '@nitric/sdk'

const api = nitric.api('public')
const analyseJob = nitric.jobDefintion('analyse')

api.post('/submit-job', async (ctx) => {
  await analyseJob.submit({
    someKey: 'someValue',
  })
})
```

```python
from nitric.resources import api, job_definition
from nitric.application import Nitric

analyse_job = job_definition("analyse")
public_api = api("public")

@public_api.post("/submit-job")
async def submit_job(ctx):
    await analyse_job.submit({
        "someKey": "someValue"
    })

Nitric.run()
```
